# Debug React Native Library in iOS

So here we suppose to have two project, one is the library itself ( we will call library project), and the other is the example ios project (we will call example project) with the library as a dependency.

How to configure Xcode

1. create a new workspace.
2. drag both projects into the workspace.
3. delete any related dependencys in the `build phrase` in the example project.
4. Product --> Schema --> Manage Schema --> Choose the example project schema --> in `build`, add the library schema
5. clear the build, and run again!
